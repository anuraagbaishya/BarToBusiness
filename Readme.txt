The scope of this project is to provide an easy way to exchange business or contact cards among people. It not only saves paper but also gives a very efficient way to get information of other personal. If cards has to be given to a big gathering then rather than distributing visiting cards, one can easily display a QR code and get the benefit of saving  money as well as  the work being done in no time. The origin of this product is from the hardship faced by employees and businessmen. To reduce this workload of distributing their information through written cards(which can be lost anywhere), a modern virtual card can be distributed which can be saved as well as synced online.
